# iOS11 Barcode Reader Example
A simple Barcode Reader example, that specifically reads QR Codes. You can generate QR codes pretty much anywhere online. 
I've used [this](http://zxing.appspot.com/generator/) website for my testing.

This example uses the new `Vision` framework being released with iOS 11.
